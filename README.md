# multiple-linear-analysis-to-estimate-sales

### Project Overview

  The goal of this project is to create multiple linear regression models that predicts sales taking into account variables like TV, social media promotion. 
  According to the model, High TV promotional budgets, and Radio promotion have a substantial positive influence on sales. 

  
### Business Understanding

  A small business company wants to know which promotional channel (TV, Radio, Social Media, Influencers) will yeild the best sales for thier company.
  If we can predict the sales revenues each promotional channel will likely yeild, it can help significantly the marketing team.

  
### Data Understanding

  This project uses a dataset called marketing_sales_data. It represents the amount of money spent on TV, radio, and social media promotions, as well as the corresponding sales. It is a fictional dataset that was created for learning purposes and made available on Kaggle.


### Modelling and Evaluation

### Conclusion

  According to the model:
      High TV promotional budgets have a substantial positive influence on sales. The model estimates that switching from a high to medium TV promotional budget reduces sales by $\$75.3120$ million (95% CI $[-82.431,-68.193])$, and switching from a high to low TV promotional budget reduces sales by $\$154.297$ million (95% CI $[-163.979,-144.616])$. 
      
  The model also estimates that an increase of $\$1$ million in the radio promotional budget will yield a $\$2.9669$ million increase in sales (95% CI $[2.551,3.383]$).
Thus, it is recommended that the business allot a high promotional budget to TV when possible and invest in radio promotions to increase sales.
